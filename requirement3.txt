In this Assignment we work in this task 
Database should store login, password and token issued to user during the authentication
As a database you can use any SQL database( postgresql, mysql, sqlite)
Database should have at least one Table with name User, and columns: id, login, password, token
User Table should contain at least 3 records
Web server should provide at least 2 routes
/login
Use as a baseline a code which was provided in a Week 6, Moodle
After successful login( if login and password matches with a record in User Table), as response route should return html text: token: <token value> and store that token in the User Table
If provided login and password does not exist in the User Table, as a response route should return html text: Could not found a user with login: <login>
/protected
This route should receive as a parameter token value
Token value needs to be passed over URL, 
e.g. http://127.0.01:5000/protected?token=24230ifdsjfjdsklfj43943ut943
This route should return html text: <h1>Hello, token which is provided is correct </h1>, if as a parameter RIGHT token value is passed
This route should return html text: <h1>Hello, Could not verify the token </h1>, if as a parameter WRONG token value is passed
Also, for that we use pyjwt (https://pyjwt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
flask (https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/)
flask_sqlalchemy (https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/)
this kind of libraries.
